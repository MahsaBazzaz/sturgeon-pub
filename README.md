## Setup

To install pipenv, if needed:
```
pip3 install pipenv
```

To set up environment:
```
pipenv install
pipenv shell
```

See `examples_basic.sh`, `examples_app.sh`, `examples_blend.sh`, `examples_mkiii.sh`, `examples_junction.sh`, `examples_graph.sh` and `examples_explore.sh` for example usage (within pipenv).
